    <p> Worl War 1 was the first mechanized war in history. In the beginning, fighting was simular to wars fought in the previous century. But new and terryfying weapons were introdused that completely changed the whole style of warfare. Aircraft were used for the first time to observe the enemy and to locate suitable targets for the long-range artillery. Later on, fighter planes began to shoot down the spotters, introdusing aerial warfare. Aircraft and Zepplein airships were used as bombers. The most terrifying new weapon was poison gas, which was used by both sides. It caused millions of deaths and terrible suffering. Tanks also made their first appearance.
